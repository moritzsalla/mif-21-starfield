# MIF Starfield

Uses the [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/).

⚠️ Performance is highly dependent on point cloud density. At the moment it's set to an amount that will run smoothely on most browsers. Feel free to tweak it to see a more densely populated star field.

To run locally, install the necessary npm packages by running `yarn install`. `yarn dev` will spin up a development server at `http://localhost:1234`.

To create a production build, run `yarn build`. This will build static files to the `dist` folder.

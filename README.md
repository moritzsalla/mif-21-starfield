To compile and run this project locally, you will need to have installed [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer.

Depending on which package manager you chose, use the terminal to `cd` into the project directory and run `yarn install` or `npm install`, respectively. This will install all necessary dependencies.

Once installation is complete, `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` will spin up a development server at `http://localhost:1234`.

To run a production build, run `yarn build` or `npm build`. This will build to the `dist` folder.

All necessary variables to customize the scene are located at the top of `index.js`.
